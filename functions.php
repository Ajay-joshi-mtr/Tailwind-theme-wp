 * WELCOME
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Thank you for using Mountain Breeze. We hope you find it a pleasure to use.
 * We've tried our hardest to make things as simple as possible, although you'll
 * note that there is no style.css file included in the repo.
 *
 * To get it, run `npm install` from the theme directory, followed by `npm run dev`.
 * For further information, checkout the README or visit https://github.com/lukeraymonddowning/MountainBreeze

/**
 * In order to avoid cluttering your functions file, we include our own here at the top.
 * This file is nothing special. It removes jQuery and enqueues your styles
 * (including Tailwind CSS) and scripts (including Alpine JS)
