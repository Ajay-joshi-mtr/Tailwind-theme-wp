Description: Our default theme for 2020 is designed to take full advantage of the flexibility of the block editor. Organizations and businesses have the ability to create dynamic landing pages with endless layouts using the group and column blocks. The centered content column and fine-tuned typography also makes it perfect for traditional blogs. Complete editor styles give you a good idea of what your content will look like, even before you publish. You can give your site a personal touch by changing the background colors and the accent color in the Customizer. The colors of all elements on your site are automatically calculated based on the colors you pick, ensuring a high, accessible color contrast for your visitors.

This theme replaces old, worn out libraries like jQuery & Bootstrap with modern, small and powerful ones like
Tailwind CSS and Alpine JS. It also bundles in Laravel Mix for easy webpack management.

It is designed as a base to build your custom themes from, and not as a standalone theme itself.

All credit goes to the authors of the respective packages for their amazing contributions to open source.
